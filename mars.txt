I am Dracula
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons maybe a problem for Wolfman
Mommy will appreciate the lack of humidity
I veto Mars. No worm-blooded food. Dracula should also hate it.
I say we go to Earth. Lots of food, one moon, not too hot.
I <3 cold blooded. Wolfman has to deal w it.
